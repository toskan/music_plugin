User needs:
LAST.FM account and an API account (create it https://www.last.fm/api ) which will include an API KEY and SECRET. There will be prompts in the extension pop-up to insert those.

The extension allows a user to add the content they are listening to on WFMU RADIO to their LAST.FM account's recent tracks. When songs are favorited on WFMU RADIO those are added to the user's loved tracks in their LAST.FM account.
