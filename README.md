User needs:
LAST.FM account and get an API Key and Secret (create it at https://www.last.fm/api ). There will be prompts in the extension pop-up to insert those.

The extension allows a user to add the content they are listening to on WFMU RADIO to their LAST.FM account's recent tracks. 

Scrobbles live at:
https://wfmu.org/listen-live/
https://tunein.com/radio/WFMU-911-s28808/
https://www.radio.net/s/wfmu
https://onlineradiobox.com/us/wfmu/?cs=us.wfmu
And on the WFMU page with the currently playiing playlist.

When songs are favorited on WFMU RADIO those are added to the user's loved tracks in their LAST.FM account.

The extension uses LAST.FM api's love.track and scrobble.track methods to accompliish this.
