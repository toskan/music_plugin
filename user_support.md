Login to your Last.fm account and navigate to [this Last.fm page](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create?_pjax=%23content) to create your Last.fm credentials. The only required field is 'Application name'. You can name it whatever you like.

After you submit the form you will receive your API key and secret which you can then enter into the extension popup by clicking on it in the top right hand corner of the chrome browser where it iis  pinned. If you need to reference your API key and secret again, you can find it [here](https://www.last.fm/api/accounts).

First submit the key, then click on the pinned extension again to submit the secret.

This will prompt a new last.fm tab to open requesting permission to connect the app.

Once permission is granted you should receive a notification that the application is ready to scrobble your WFMU tracks. If you have notifications turned off you can check the extension pop-up which should state whether or not the process was completed successfully.

If the process was not successful, you can select the **Reset Key and Sercret** link inside the pop-up which will allow you to try again.

The extension can track what you are listening to on these sites:
